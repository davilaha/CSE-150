# For this assignment I created a simple firewall using OpenFlow-enabled switches.     #
# The term “firewall” is derived from building construction: a firewall is a wall      #
# you place in buildings to stop a fire from spreading. In the case of networking,     # 
# it is the act of providing security by not letting specified traffic pass through    #
# the firewall. This feature is good for minimizing attack vectors and limiting the    #
# network “surface” exposed to attackers.                                              #
#                                                                                      #
